-----------------

With the advance of eye-tracking technology, hands-free application control with your eyes is not a future scenario anymore. Lattice Menu is a robust eye gaze-controlled menu employing a lattice of visual anchors. You can stably and quickly trigger commands using target-assisted gaze gestures over the visual anchors of Lattice Menu. This project was published in [CHI 2022](https://chi2022.acm.org/).
